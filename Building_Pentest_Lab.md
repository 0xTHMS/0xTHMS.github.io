I've been thinking of building my own pentesting lab for a while but I was a bit reluctant to put up a whole hypervisor for something pentest related.
Today, I searched for "cloud pentesting" and as it seems, AWS offers some servers with Kali preinstalled, as well as their useful API.
This would permit us to get a lot of ressources depending on our attack surface and therefore gain some precious time (duplicates?) when subimming bounties.

So I'll show you what I am currently building, so far the plan is:
- a **big**, **fat** box so that I can crack hashes faster than ever.
- an S3 bucket containing the awesome curated list that was on github not long ago.
- a few LXCs so I can make tests and try to trap some skiddies.



Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or `keyword`.
